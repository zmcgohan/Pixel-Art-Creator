:.:.: Sprite Creator :.:.:

This application provides an easy method of drawing and animating pixel art in a format which allows for efficient and simple rendering.

Features:
	- Unlimited size of art
	- Works on mobile/tablets
	- 'Highlighted' part of screen = image dimensions
	- Able to set size or have program resize as needed
	- Tools:
		+ Basic pen
		+ Rectangle select
		+ Move
		+ Bucket fill
		+ Replace color
		+ Mirror tools
		+ Selection rotate
		+ Vertical/horizontal flip
		+ Shapes tool (circles, rectangles, lines)
		+ Lighten/darken
		+ Color picker
	- Systems:
		+ Main grid
		+ Layers
		+ Palettes (4/5 color easy-switch)
		+ Animation frames
			- Onion-skinning option
		+ Frame management system
		+ Export (GIF, PNG, custom)

Code setup:
	- Grid: Main grid of application
		+ Only allows moving view up until curSprite is only a few pixels in-view
		+ curSprite: current Sprite being edited, its current frame, and location
		+ bgSprites: transparent background sprites (for onion-skinning & comparison), their locations and current frames
		+ numCells: number of 
		+ cellWidth: cell width in pixels (used for zoom)
		+ topLeftViewPos: top left position of view of grid (relative to 0,0=topleft at beginning) in pixels
		+ lineColor: color of lines on grid
		+ bgColor: color of background cells
	- Sprite: Set of all frames of an animated sprite
		+ width, height: dimensions of Sprite in pixels
		+ frames: SpriteFrames of Sprite
	- SpriteFrame: An individual frame of a sprite's animation
		+ pixels: 2D array of pixels in frame, sized by width & height of Sprite
	- Window: An editable portion of the screen for housing a system (like color palette, frames, etc.)
		+ position: position of window on screen (in pixels)
		+ width, height: dimensions of Window in pixels
		+ Inheriting:
			- ToolWindow
			- ColorPaletteWindow
			- LayerWindow
			- AnimationWindow
	- ColorPalette: A set of colors
		+ colors: array of different colors in palette

	
Sprite Creator's custom format:
	- Purpose: Meant to enable easy rendering and storing of voxel sprites in HTML5 or other systems (rather than a PNG sprite sheet, etc.)
	- Implementation: For now, just stores individual pixels of each sprite's frames. Aims to keep size of images as small as possible while ignoring any irrelevant details.
		+ Possible future additions:
			- Only stores changes of each frame
			- Reduces storage to rectangles of pixels for quicker rendering
