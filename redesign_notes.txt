:.:.: Pixel Art Program :.:.:

The main purpose of this major refactor is to put mobile first.

Most calculation things are already handled in the first version, but the current system in place is pretty obfuscated when it comes to how things are organized, how events are handled, etc.

Changes:
	- Every object can access every other object -- windows = own entities/variables, grid = global, all other main systems = global
	- Mobile and touch events handled as necessary (weird laptops with touch/click should work)
	- Event-handling only uses necessary information rather than passing whole events (pass coordinates of click, amount of scroll/move, etc.)
	- Windows are their own entities, have their own global variables and not housed in an array
	- Windows immovable for now (most likely add that in later -- just adds complexity at this point)
	- Making sure that only the parts of the screen that -need updated- get updated -- more efficient, faster
	- All displayable things render themselves (their own render() functions)
